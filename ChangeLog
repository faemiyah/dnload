r1?? (2015-??-??)
  * Better Raspberry Pi support via VideoCore / EGL specifics.

r193 (2015-02-11)
  * Raspberry Pi (Linux-armel) support.
  * Bugfixes (works on Python 3 again).

r189 (2015-02-04)
  * Use 'unsafe' DT_SYMTAB / DT_HASH location assumption from minas/Calodox.
  * Only treat d_un pointers as offsets on FreeBSD.
  * Make hashed symbol table order stable, decreases compressed size.
  * Fix bugs that had crept into legacy compilation modes.
  * Minor Python style improvements.

r183 (2015-02-03)
  * Default to debugger trap for terminating to save some space.
  * Use fixed r_debug address trick from minas/Calodox.
  * Preliminary support for using elfling by minas/Calodox for two-stage
    compression. Actual elfling source not yet included.
  * Do not create unnecessary .bss fields for required UND symbols.
  * Fix errors in entry point crunching.
  * Less offensively bad Python coding conventions.

r174 (2014-09-24)
  * Platform-dependant pick on compression header.
  * Fix byte-by-byte section merging bug.
  * Make quad example simpler and intro example more complex.
  * Default to filedump header that does not look 'nice' to save some space.

r152 (2014-08-17)
  * Support DT_GNU_HASH in addition to DT_HASH on Linux.
  * Add symbol definitions.
  * New bsd_rand from up-to-date FreeBSD.

r115 (2014-06-21)
  * Additional GL function definitions (can now compile flow2).
  * Better handling of GLAPIENTRY.
  * Add NOMINMAX define so windows.h does not clobber std namespace max/min.

r112 (2014-06-06)
  * Allow compiler to assign values for system calls.
  * Better header crunching on 64-bit.

r106 (2014-06-05)
  * Remove also unnecessary symbol definitions on non-FreeBSD platforms.
  * Properly crunch amd64 entry point.
  * Create DT_HASH in a generic manner.

r99 (2014-06-04)
  * Elf64 / amd64 support.
  * Use empty DT_SYMTAB trick on Linux.
  * Bugfixes.

r83 (2014-05-31)
  * Omit unnecessary 'environ' and '__progname' symbols on non-FreeBSD platforms.
  * Construct .hash, .strtab and .symtab as needed.
  * Enable changing entry point, use a better compressable one.
  * Added README that points to the online documentation.

r79 (2014-05-30)
  * First public version.
